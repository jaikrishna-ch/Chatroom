How to run the code?
First go to eclipse-->import--->web--->war--->runtime--->apache 1.7(or 8)--->war deployed--->open web--->admin.jsp--->
run this on server.
This chatroom won't start until the admin of the chatroom gives permission to use, the admin would have this specific file and when he runs this jsp file on server the chatroom begins.
Now the chatroom is accessible through your browsers through:
http://localhost:8080/Chatroom/welcome.jsp 
After this the name restriction has been made,
the available chatrooms and number of chatrooms are displayed(name and number)
You are supposed to enter a non null string to create a chatroom.
If you enter a null you get an error , if you enter the name of a chatroon that already exists an error is generated, else a new chatroom is created and this is added to the object that I am transferring from the front end to back end.


Next comes the user nickname entering page , after which he joins the group.

THE ABOVE RAR FILE CONTAINS THE ENTIRE ECLIPSE PROJECT AS YOU'VE ASKED FOR .
